  "body": " (1\/5) Student Quick Guide    What are Parsons Puzzles?  Parsons Puzzles give you mixed-up lines of code. Your job is to drag them into the correct order and set proper indentation to make a working program.    How to Solve  1. Read the Problem  Understand what the function should do. Look at the example inputs and outputs.  2. Drag Lines to the Right  Move code lines from the left side to the right side in the order you think is correct.  3. Set Indentation  Some lines need to be indented. Use arrows to indent or unindent lines. Getting indentation right is important in Python!  4. Check Your Solution  Click Check button to see if your solution is correct. Lines that are incorrect will be highlighted in red. Lines that are correct will be highlighted in green.  5. Try Again if Wrong  Look at which lines are red, think about what needs to change, and try again. Keep trying until all lines are green!    Important Rules  Work Independently  No help from friends, internet, or books. Do your best on your own.  Complete All Four Puzzles  Try your best on each puzzle. If you cannot solve it, do your best and move on.  Take Your Time  Think carefully. The total session should take about 40-50 minutes.  Do Puzzles in Order  Start with Puzzle 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. Do not skip ahead.  Need Help?  Raise your hand if you have questions about the interface or if something isn't working. The coordinator can help with technical issues but cannot help solve the problems.  Good Luck!    Consent to Participate  You are invited to participate in a research study about how students approach programming.   Purpose of the study: This study aims to understand how students solve Parsons Puzzles.   What you will do: You will be asked to complete a brief background survey, learn about a type of code puzzle, and then solve a series of code puzzles.   Data collected: Your survey answers and your interactions with the puzzles (including your drag-and-drop actions) will be anonymously recorded.   Voluntary Participation: Your participation is completely voluntary. Your decision will not affect your grades or standing in any course.   Contact: If you have any questions, please contact Athira L I at athirali.pgtcs@gmail.com.     By selecting \"Yes\" below, you confirm that you have read and understood the information above, and agree to participate in this study.     Yes, I agree to participate in the survey.   Thank you! Please click the \"Next\" button to begin.     No, I do not wish to participate.   Thank you for your time. You may now exit the survey.       "

  "body": " (3\/5) Introduction to Parsons Puzzles   Welcome to the Parsons Puzzles practice session! In this section, you will get familiar with how Parsons Puzzles work before attempting the actual test puzzles.  A Parsons Puzzle presents you with all the lines of code needed to solve a programming task, but they are mixed up. Your job is to:    Drag the code blocks from the left side to the right side  Arrange them in the correct order  Set the proper indentation for each line    Let's start with a simple practice puzzle to get you comfortable with the interface.    Practice Puzzle 1: Simple Function  This is a simple warm-up problem. Try to arrange the code blocks in the correct order to create a function that prints a greeting message.    Arrange the following code blocks to create a function called greet that takes a name as a parameter and prints \"Hello, [name]!\"     def greet(name):    message = \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"    print(message)      Tips for solving Parsons Puzzles:     Read the problem description carefully  Think about the logical flow of the program  Pay attention to indentation - it matters in Python!  Use the Check button to test your solution  Don't worry if you make mistakes - you can try again      Practice Puzzle 2: Conditional Statement  Now let's try a slightly more complex problem that involves a conditional statement.    Arrange the code blocks to create a function called check_positive that takes a number as a parameter and returns True if the number is positive, and False otherwise.     def check_positive(num):    if num > 0:    return True    else:    return False        Practice Puzzle 3: With Paired Distractors  This puzzle includes paired distractors . For some steps, you will be presented with a choice between a correct code block and an incorrect one. Your job is to identify and use only the correct block from each pair. This is what you'll see in the test problems.    Arrange the code blocks to create a function called is_even that takes a number and returns True if it's even, False if it's odd.     def is_even(num):     if num % 2 == 0:    if num % 2 = 0:     return True    else:     return False    return true       Notice: You had to choose the correct line from pairs of correct and incorrect code. In the test, you'll also need to identify which lines are correct and which are distractors.    Are You Ready?  Great work on the practice problems! You should now be familiar with:    How to drag and drop code blocks  How to arrange blocks in the correct order  How to set proper indentation  How to check your solution and interpret feedback      Do you feel ready to proceed to the actual Parsons Puzzles test?     Yes, I'm ready to start the test    I need more practice (you can review the puzzles above)      When you're ready, click the Next button to begin the test section.   Remember: In the test section, you will have four puzzles to solve. Take your time, read each problem carefully, and do your best!   "

Easy - solved quickly    Moderate - took some thinking    Hard - struggled significantly        Puzzle 2: Find Maximum    Arrange the code blocks to create a function called find_max that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest number.  Example: find_max([3, 7, 2, 9, 1]) should return 9      def find_max(numbers):     max_val = numbers[0]    max_val = 0     for num in numbers:     if num > max_val:    if num < max_val:     max_val = num    return max_val       Did you solve this puzzle?     Yes, I solved it correctly    I tried but could not solve it       How difficult was this puzzle?     Easy - solved quickly    Moderate - took some thinking    Hard - struggled significantly        Puzzle 3: Count Matches    Arrange the code blocks to create a function called count_matches that takes a list of numbers and a target value, and returns how many times the target appears in the list.  Example: count_matches([5, 3, 5, 7, 5], 5) should return 3      def count_matches(numbers, target):    count = 0    for num in numbers:     if num == target:    if num != target:      count = count + 1    count = count + num     return count       Did you solve this puzzle?     Yes, I solved it correctly    I tried but could not solve it       How difficult was this puzzle?     Easy - solved quickly    Moderate - took some thinking    Hard - struggled significantly        Puzzle 4: Find First Match    Arrange the code blocks to create a function called find_first that takes a list of numbers and a target value, and returns True if the target is found in the list, or False if it is not found.  Example: find_first([2, 5, 8, 5], 5) returns True      def find_first(numbers, target):    for num in numbers:     if num == target:    if num != target:      return True    return False     return False       Did you solve this puzzle?     Yes, I solved it correctly    I tried but could not solve it       How difficult was this puzzle?     Easy - solved quickly    Moderate - took some thinking    Hard - struggled significantly        Congratulations! You have completed all four Parsons Puzzles.  Please proceed to the final feedback survey to share your experience.   "
